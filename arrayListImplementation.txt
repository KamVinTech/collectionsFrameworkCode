=====Arraylist Implementations and Operations=====
initial Arraylist after adding 10 integers:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Arraylist after adding element '7' at Index '5' :[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Arraylist after removing element from Index 2: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Arraylist after replacing the element '11' at index '3' :[1, 2, 4, 11, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Element at the last Index is: 10

Index9:10
Index8:9
Index7:8
Index6:7
Index5:6
Index4:7
Index3:11
Index2:4
Index1:2
Index0:1
Size of Arraylist before adding 5 new elements: 10
Arraylist size after adding 10 elements: 20
First Occurence of Element '11':3
Last Occurence of Element '11':10
Does arraylist contains the target: true
After Removing duplicates from the 2 lists and merging them to Set:
[1, 2, 4, 11, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 40, 50]
